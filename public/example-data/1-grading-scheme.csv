It is used when only one instance of a class is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as a logging system or a configuration manager. It is typically implemented by making the constructor private and providing a static method that returns the single instance. For example, in a logging system, you only need one logger instance to ensure that all logs are written to the same file or console.",,"The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is used to prevent the creation of multiple instances of a class when exactly one instance is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as in a logging system, configuration manager, or thread pool. It solves problems related to resource management and consistency. The typical implementation involves making the constructor private to prevent instantiation and providing a static method that returns the single instance of the class. This method checks if the instance exists; if not, it creates it. For example, in a logging system, having a single logger instance ensures that all log entries are written to the same file, avoiding issues with file locking and inconsistent log entries.",,,,,
